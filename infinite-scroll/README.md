# infinite-scroll

This app demonstrates using HTMX to implement infinite scroll.

To run this:

- `bun install`
- `bun run dev`
- browse localhost:1919/index.html

If "index.html" is omitted from the URL, Elysia will not serve it by default.
Instead, the following error will be displayed:
"MacOS does not support sending non-regular files"
